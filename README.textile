h1. Welcome to FeedChamp

p. FeedChamp is a light-weight RSS Feed Agregator programmed in Camping.
It's really just an experiment right now, but perhaps you will find
it useful.


h2. Installation

FeedChamp depends on the following gems:

bc.   camping
  simple-rss
  sqlite3-ruby

If you have problems installing the sqlite3 gem see "this":http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/camping/wiki/BeAlertWhenOnSqlite3

Once you have the dependencies installed copy @feedchamp.rb@ into the
directory of your choice, create a configuration file,  and start the
camping server:

bc. camping -d feedchamp.db .


h2. Configuration

Configuration for FeedChamp is simple. Just create a YAML file in the
same directory that feedchamp.rb is installed and call it @config.yml@.

Here is a sample configuration file:

bc.   title: My Feed Planet
