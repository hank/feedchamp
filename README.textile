== Welcome to FeedChamp

FeedChamp is a light-weight RSS Feed Agregator programmed in Camping.
It's really just an experiment right now, but perhaps you will find
it useful.


== Installation

FeedChamp depends on the following gems:

  camping
  simple-rss
  sqlite3-ruby

If you have problems installing the sqlite3 gem see:

  http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/camping/wiki/BeAlertWhenOnSqlite3

Once you have the dependencies installed copy feedchamp.rb into the
directory of your choice, create a configuration file,  and start the
camping server:

  camping -d feedchamp.db .


== Configuration

Configuration for FeedChamp is simple. Just create a YAML file in the
same directory that feedchamp.rb is installed and call it config.yml.

Here is a sample configuration file:

bc, title: My Feed Planet
  feeds:
    - http://firstwebsite.com/feed.rss
    - http://secondwebsite.com/feed.rss
